# Faultline SMP

Custom Minecraft survival server (formerly **Limbo SMP**, renamed to **Faultline SMP**).
Owner: ndjdjs (YouTube: vo0ise). Talks casually and directly, pushes back when something
is wrong, prefers concrete/data-backed answers over generic advice.

> This file was rebuilt from claude.ai saved memory (the original claude.ai chats were not
> in the data export). If something here is wrong or outdated, fix it here.

## Server setup
- **Paper** server, with **Geyser** (Bedrock players) and **ViaVersion**.
- Paper API target: `1.21.11-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`, `api-version: '1.21'`. Resource packs use
  `pack_format` 75 (FaultlineSMP.zip supports 69–75).
- Hosting: moved from Apex Hosting to a **self-managed OVHcloud VPS**.
  (Apex/Bisect are competitors — Faultline can't appear in BisectHosting sponsor content.)
- Third-party plugin: **DropHeads** by EvModder.

## Gameplay design
- **Currency is player heads.** The **Black Market** building trades player heads for
  shulker boxes based on a staff-assigned tier.
- **Tiers:** numeric 1–8 (1 worst, 8 best). 6–8 are reserved for MC Comp-level players.
- **Scrapped:** permadeath and the ban/"Otherside" system. (Older plugin code had
  permadeath phases — don't build on that unless asked.)
- **Sidebar scoreboard** titled "Faultline SMP": kills, deaths, ping.
- **/leaderboard**: kills only.
- **Faultline Index**: in-game item & creature codex. Crafted from Leather + Book, and given
  on first join.

## Custom plugins: source in `plugins/`
All are Maven projects: Java 21, `paper-api 1.21.11-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`. Build with
`cd plugins/<Name> && mvn package`; the jar lands in `target/`.

| Plugin | Package | What it does | Commands |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LimboBlackMarket** | `net.limbosmp.blackmarket` | Head-tier economy, kill/death stats, kill streaks, anti-farm, quests + Quest Book, friendly-fire logging, global reload | `/tier`, `/markethelp`, `/stats`, `/leaderboard`, `/tierleaderboard`, `/faultlinereload` (`/freload`), `/givequestbook` |
| **FaultlineItems** | `net.faultlinesmp.items` | All custom items + accessories (2-slot `/accessories` GUI), staffs, spawn eggs, diving gear, Kraken & Diamond Jacob gear, Skeleton Wanderer cave trader, admin `/itemsmenu` | many `/give*` commands, `/itemsmenu` (`/fitems`), `/itemsreload`, `/cavetrader`, `/batform` |
| **FaultlineRaids** | `net.faultlinesmp.raids` | Zombie Raids: Zombie Omens, Zombie Captains, waves of special zombies | `/zraid <start\|stop\|captain\|menu\|egg\|omen>` |
| **FaultlineBosses** | `net.faultlinesmp.bosses` | Summonable bosses, starting with **The Demon Eye** (1000 HP, 4 phases, summoned with a Suspicious Eye) | `/demoneye <summon\|kill\|give>` |
| **FaultlineIndex** | `net.faultlinesmp.index` | The Faultline Index codex. Entries live in `src/main/resources/index.yml`, font glyphs in `glyphs.yml` | `/index [give\|reset] [player]` |

Notes:
- `FaultlineItems.java` is very large (~350 KB). Search it instead of reading it all.
- Soft dependencies: Bosses → Items, Raids; Raids → Items; Index → all the others.
- Past bugs already fixed: resource-pack race conditions, gateway teleport cross-world
  exceptions, pom.xml API version bumps.
- Earlier chats mentioned Kingdom End teleporters, permadeath phases, and per-phase
  resource packs. Check the source before assuming those still exist.

## Standing rules when updating plugins
1. **Every new item, boss, or enemy must be added to the Faultline Index.**
2. **Every new boss must be added to `/itemsmenu`** (a spawn egg or summon item).
3. If textures/models change, update the resource pack zip **and** its SHA-1 hash in config.

## Repo contents
| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `FaultlineSMP.zip` | Main combined resource pack (items, bosses, Index, sounds, cinematic font) |
| `FaultlineItemTextures.zip` | Custom item textures pack (accessories, potions, staffs, etc.) |
| `FaultlineBossesPack.zip` | Boss models/sounds pack (Demon Eye, Dune, Frostmaw, mf_* models) |
| `FaultlineBloodMoon.zip` | Blood Moon pack: replaces moon phase textures |
| `FaultlineBosses.zip` | Old zip of the FaultlineBosses source; the live copy is `plugins/FaultlineBosses/` |
| `plugins/` | Source code for all five custom plugins (edit these) |

Resource packs are served from raw GitHub links on `main`, e.g.
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faultlinesmp123-sys/Faultline-SMP/main/FaultlineBossesPack.zip`
(same pattern for `FaultlineItemTextures.zip`, `FaultlineBloodMoon.zip`, `FaultlineSMP.zip`).
Changing a zip changes its hash: recompute with `sha1sum <file>.zip` and update the plugin config.

## Building in Claude Code cloud sessions
Maven must reach `repo.papermc.io` to download paper-api. If the build fails with
`403 Forbidden` on that host, add `repo.papermc.io` to the environment's allowed network domains.
